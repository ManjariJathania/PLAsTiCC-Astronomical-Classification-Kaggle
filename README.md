# PLAsTiCC Astronomical Classification-Kaggle
 
Helped some of the world's leading astronomers grasp the deepest properties of the universe.

The human eye has been the arbiter for the classification of astronomical sources in the night sky for hundreds of years. But a new facility -- the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) -- is about to revolutionize the field, discovering 10 to 100 times more astronomical sources that vary in the night sky than we've ever known. Some of these sources will be completely unprecedented!
